# Dating App  

A simple dating application built using Angular 6 and .NET Core 2.1 where a user can register, upload photos, add dating preferences, like other users, etc.      
The project uses Cloudinary for storing images which is a scalable approach to storing images.  
The DB used is SQLite, for PROD applications this would be something like SQL Server, etc.
